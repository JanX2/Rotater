Originally written by Craig Kloeden.

An Objective-C program for rotating user specified points and lines in 3D in real time with stereo options.

Warning: the code is ancient!

I (Jan) have tried to bring this project up to current standards. It works, but there is a lot of work left to be done. 

The part that probably needs the most work is the rendering engine (in `RotaterView`). Itâ€™s very old hacked code and could use some love.
